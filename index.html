		<h1>Welcome to Andrew's Webpage!</h1>
		<p>I typically spend my time consuming a lot of media on the internet. This includes reading comics, watching TV series, movies, or anime, and watching many videos on Youtube.
		Other than that, I go to the gym every evening except Sundays. I also spend a lot of my time talking to my friends and playing video games with them. I have a natural affinity for content related to
		supernatural events, such as media involving characters with superpowers and/or supernatural abilities.</p>
