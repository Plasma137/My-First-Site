		<h1>Welcome to Andrew's Webpage!</h1>
		<p>I typically spend my time consuming a lot of media on the internet. This includes reading comics, watching TV series, movies, or anime, and watching many videos on Youtube.
		Other than that, I go to the gym every evening except Sundays. I also spend a lot of my time talking to my friends and playing video games with them. I have a natural affinity for content related to
		supernatural events, such as media involving characters with superpowers and/or supernatural abilities.</p>
		<h2>Where Am I From?</h2>
		<p>I was born in Florida, USA, however when I was only 1 year old my parents decided to move to the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean region.
		Because of this, I consider the Caribbean lifestyle to be my own and am not entirely familiar with the American culture and lifestyle. I am not entirely in the dark though, due to my parents originally living in the USA before I was born.
		This has resulted in me speaking like an American, but being in more of a grey area in who I consider I fit in with.</p>
